# Wellcome to my website!
My name is Gal Hermelin, and I’m a Data Analyst.


I previously worked as a Data Analyst in the R&D team at Redefine Meat.
My main goal was identifying correlations between key steps in the meat-mimicking process and the success of our product trials, primarily by cross-analyzing analytical data with sensory panel results to uncover patterns and insights that could guide product development.

Currently, I’m on maternity leave, spending time with my 6-month-old daughter, Bar — who is very cute! :)
